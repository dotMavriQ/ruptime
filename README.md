# Ruptime Script

This is a Bash script that allows you to set a timer from a given moment and stops the timer when a certain text is read from the Dunst program.

## Prerequisites

* Bash
* Dunst

## Usage

* Clone this repository or download the ruptime.sh file.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the ruptime.sh file is located.

* Make the ruptime.sh file executable using the following command:

`bash`

```
chmod +x ruptime.sh

```

**Run the ruptime.sh script using the following command:**

bash

`./ruptime.sh`

* Follow the prompts to set the target time and text to listen for in Dunst.

The script will then run the timer until the target time is reached or the target text is read from Dunst, whichever comes first. When the timer stops, the elapsed time will be printed.
